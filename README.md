This Python script leverages the Tweepy library to unfollow users on Twitter who do not follow you back. Before running the script, make sure to install the Tweepy library by executing the following command:
python
pip install tweepy

Setup
Obtain Twitter API keys by creating a Twitter Developer account and registering an app.

Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual Twitter API keys:

consumer_key: Your Twitter API consumer key
consumer_secret: Your Twitter API consumer secret
access_token: Your Twitter API access token
access_token_secret: Your Twitter API access token secret
How to Run
Execute the script by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
The script will identify users you follow who do not follow you back and unfollow them.

Important Notes
Use this script responsibly and be aware of Twitter API rate limits to avoid being restricted.
The script may take some time to run if you follow a large number of users.
Aggressive unfollowing behavior may violate Twitter's terms of service, so use it wisely and at your own risk.
Troubleshooting
If an error occurs during execution, it will be displayed on the console. Common errors may include issues with API keys or rate limits.

python
Copy code
try:
    unfollow_non_followers()
except tweepy.TweepError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
